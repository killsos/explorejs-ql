<h2 id="ch_preface">Preface <a class="header-anchor" href="ch_preface.html#ch_preface" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>You are reading a book about ECMAScript 6 (ES6), a new version of JavaScript. It&#x2019;s great that we can finally use that version, which had a long and eventful past: It was first conceived as ECMAScript 4, a successor to ECMAScript 3 (whose release was in December 1999). In July 2008, plans changed and the next versions of JavaScript were to be first a small incremental release (which became ES5) and then a larger, more powerful release. The latter had the code name Harmony and part of it became ES6.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 5 was standardized in December 2009. I first heard and <a href="http://www.2ality.com/2011/01/brendan-eichs-dream-for-next-version-of.html">blogged</a> about ECMAScript 6 in January 2011, when it was still called <em>Harmony</em>. The original plan was to finish ES6 in 2013, but things took longer and it was standardized in June 2015. (A more detailed account of ES6&#x2019;s history is given in <a href="ch_about-es6.html#sec_ecmascript-history">the next chapter</a>.)</p>

<p>With a few minor exceptions, I am happy how ECMAScript 6 turned out. This book describes my experiences with, and my research of, its features. Similarly to ES6, it took a long time to finish &#x2013; in a way, I started writing it in early 2011. Like my previous book &#x201C;<a href="http://speakingjs.com/">Speaking JavaScript</a>&#x201D;, I wrote most of it as a series of blog posts. I like the discussion and feedback that this open process enables, which is why this book is available for free online.</p>

<p>This book can be read online for free. If you find it useful, please support it by <a href="https://leanpub.com/exploring-es6/">buying a copy</a>. You&#x2019;ll get DRM-free PDF, EPUB, MOBI files.</p>

<p>I hope that reading the book conveys some of the fun I had investigating and playing with ES6.</p>
