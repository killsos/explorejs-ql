Announcement:

I have written a new book: “Setting up ES6”. Everyone who owns “Exploring ES6” right now can get a free copy via this coupon (valid until January 11): [sent via email to owners]

As a step towards a stable version 1.0 of “Exploring ES6”, along with a print version (hopefully by mid-2016), I have moved Chap. “Deploying ES6” to the new book. Apologies for the inconveniences this causes, but it was the only way of keeping “Exploring ES6” from aging too quickly.

* New entry in the glossary: “protocol”
